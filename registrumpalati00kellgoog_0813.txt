On 25 July 1822, the House of Commons presented an addi-ess to the
Crovrn, stating that the editions of the worhs of our ancient historiam wore
incoureuicnt aud defectire3 that nrany of their writings still remained in
manuscript, and, in some ceses, in a single copy only. They added, “ thet au
“ uniform and convenient edition of the whole, published under His Majesty's
“ royal sanction, would be an undertaking honourable to His Majcsty’s reign,
“ and condueive te the advnncement of historical and constitutional know-
“ ledge; that the House therefore humbly besought His Majesty, that He
“ would be graciously pleesed to give such directions as His Majesty, in His
‘⁴ wisdom, might think fit, for the publication of acomplete edition of the
“ ancient historiens of this realrn, and assured His Majesty that whatever
“ expense might be necessary fer this purpose would be made good.’'

'l'he Mastcr of the Ralla, being very dosirous that effect should be given
to the resolution of the House of Commens, submitted to Her Majesty's
Treasury in 1857 a plan for the publication of the ancient chronieles and
memoriale ef the United Kingdom, and it was adopted accordingly. In
selecting these works, it was considered right, in the first instance, te
give preference to those of which the manuscripts were unique, or the
materiale of which would help to fill up blanks in English history for
which no satisfactory aud authentia informatien hitherto existed in any '
accessible ferm. One great object the Mastcr of the Rolls irad in view was
to forma eorpus historicum within reasonable limite, and which should bo
as complete as possible. In a subject of so vast a range, it was important
that the historical student should be able to select such volumes as conformed
with his own peculiar testes and studies, and not be put to the expense of
purchasing the whole collection3 an inconvenience inseparable from any
other plan than that which has been in this instance adopted. Ι

of the Chronicles and Memorials, the following volumes have been pub-
lished. They embrace the period from the earliest time of British history
down to the end of the reign of Henry VII.
