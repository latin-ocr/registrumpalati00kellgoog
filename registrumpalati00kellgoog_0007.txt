On the 26th of January 1857, the Mastoroi tho Rolls
submitted to the lheasnry a proposal for the publication
ol materiale lor the History ot this Oountry from the
Invasion of theItomans to the reign of 'Henry VIII.

'I'he Master oi the Rolls suggested that these materiola
should be‘ selected sor publication under competent
adltcrs without reference to periodical or chronological ,
arrangement, without· mutilation or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first· instance, to such matoriuls
as were most source and valuable.

Hc proposed that each chronicle or historical docu-
ment to bc edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on 'au Editio Princeps3 and
for this purpose the most correct text should he formed
from an accurato collatiou ol the best MSS.

'Io render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of tho MSS. employed by him, oi their age and
thais peculimities ; that he should add to the work a '
brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary to explain thc chronology; but
no othdr note or comment was to hc allowed, except
what might be necessary to establish the correctness of

the text. J
