As far back as the year 1800, a Committee of the House of Commons
recommended that Indcxes and Calendars should be mado to the Publio
Records, and thirty-six years afterwards another Committee of the House 01
Commons reiterated that recommendation in more forcible words; but it
was not until the incorporation of the State Paper Office with the Publio
Record Office that the Master of the Rolls found himself in a position to take
the necessary steps for canying out the wishes 01 the House of Commons.

00 7 December 1855, he stated to the Lords 01 tha Treasury that although
‘⁸ the Records‚ State Papers‚ and Documenta in his charge constitute the most
“ complete and perfect series 01 their kind in the cirilized world,” and
although “they are of 1110 greatest velue 10 a historioal and constitutionul
“point oi view, yet they are comparatively useless to the public, from the

“ want 01 proper Calendars and Indexes.’'

Acting upon the recommendatione 01 the Committees of the House 01
Commons above referred 10, he suggested to the Lords 01 the Treesury that
to effect the object he hed in view it would be necessary for him to employ a ι
few persons fully qualified to perform the work which he contemplated.

Their Lordships assented to the necessity of having Calendars prepared

and printed, and empowered the Master of the Bolis to take such steps as f

might be necessary 101 this purpose.

The following Works hare been already published under the directior of
the Master of the Rolls :-
